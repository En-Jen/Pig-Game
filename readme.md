## GAME RULES:

1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to hold and pass on the turn to his opponent. Each result gets added to his ROUND score.

   * If the player rolls a 1, all his accumulated ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn

   * The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn

3. The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
